	</header>
<p>
	CSS selectors can be classified into following categories. Basic Selectors, Attribute Selectors, Combinator Selectors, Pseudo classes and Pseudo elements
</p>

<p><h4>Basic Selectors:</h4> Basic selectors are <ul>
	<li>Id selectors: '#id-name' '#' char is used before name of the selector to indiacate it is a Id selector and then the nale of the Id is specified.</li>
	<li>class selecors: '.class-Name' '.' char is used before name of the selector to indiacate it is a Id selector and then the nale of the Id is specified.</li>
	<li>Type selector: give the type of the element such as div/p/h4 etc to select the elements and one can start with assigning CSS properties.</li>
	<li>universal selector: the wild card used here to select all the elements is '*'.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h4>Attribute Selectors:</h4> Attribute selectors are used to select the elements based on the attribute property and also based on its values( monkeynewkey key keys keying monkey)
under attribute selectors following are options.
<p>For example if DOM has few div elements which we want select having attribute 'class' and having multiple values(like newkey key keys keying and monkey) with space separated.</p>
<ul>
	<li>[class*="key"] is used to select all the div elements with attribute 'class' having 'key' among or as a part on any of the values(newkey key keys keying)</li>
	<li>[class^="key"] is used to select all the div elements with attribute 'class' having 'key' in the begining of one of the values(key keys keying)</li>
	<li>[class$="key"] is used to select all the div elements with attribute 'class' having 'key' in the ending of one of the values(key monkey)</li>
	<li>[class~="key"] is used to select all the div elements with attribute 'class' having 'key' as exactly one of the values(key)</li>
</ul>
